# WAVE access tool for Jacobs

This tool will connect to the public WAVE agents and access the public sensor data streams
for the Jacobs Institute for Design building.

The output, after the `====` line, is a series of JSON documents representing the
real-time sensor feed.

Some pre-compiled versions are available on the releases tab. Only the ubuntu/amd64 version
is well tested, file an issue on this github page if you try a different OS and it does
not work as expected.
